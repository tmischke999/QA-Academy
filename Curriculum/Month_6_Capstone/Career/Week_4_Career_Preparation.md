### **Topics Covered**

1. **Resume Writing and Tailoring for QA Roles**:

   - **Crafting a Professional Summary**:
     - For students transitioning from non-QA roles, highlight transferable skills and training experiences gained during the QA Academy.
     - Example: "Aspiring QA professional with a background in [prior role, e.g., customer service] and hands-on experience in manual and automated testing through a comprehensive training program. Skilled in tools like Playwright, Postman, and Lighthouse. Dedicated to ensuring application quality and user satisfaction."
   - **Tailoring Resumes for QA Roles**:
     - Research QA job postings to understand the required skills.
     - Modify your resume to match job-specific keywords and responsibilities.
     - Example Keywords: "test case creation," "API automation," "defect reporting," "performance testing."
   - **Highlighting Capstone Project**:
     - Include your capstone project under "Projects" or "Experience" with measurable outcomes.
     - Example: "Designed and executed a test plan covering UI and API testing, achieving 95% defect detection before release. Created reusable Playwright scripts for login and checkout flows."

2. **Understanding Job Postings and Matching Skills**:

     - Break down job postings to extract key requirements (e.g., "Experience with Jira and Selenium" or "Proficiency in SQL").
     - Match your resume to these requirements by showcasing relevant experience or training.
   - **Optimizing Resumes with Keywords**:
     - Identify important keywords such as "automated testing," "bug tracking," or "regression testing."
     - Include these terms naturally in your resume to pass applicant tracking systems (ATS).
     - Example: "Performed exploratory and regression testing using TestRail, resulting in a 30% reduction in production defects."
   - **Tailoring Cover Letters**:
     - Personalize your cover letter to reflect your transition into QA and highlight your strengths gained during the program.
