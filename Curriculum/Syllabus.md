## Training Timeline and Structure

### **Phase 1: Foundational Context and Tool Setup (Month 1)**
**Objective:** Build foundational knowledge of QA, ensure all tools are installed and configured, and introduce version control using GitHub.  

**Topics Covered:**
- Introduction to Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and QA.
- QA Roles and Responsibilities.
- Overview of Testing Types: Manual, Accessibility, and API Testing.
- Setting up tools:
  - Text Editors (e.g., VS Code).
  - Postman for API testing.
  - Browser developer tools.
  - Accessibility testing tools (e.g., NVDA, Axe, Lighthouse).
  - Bug tracking tools (e.g., Jira).
- Version Control with GitHub:
  - Setting up a GitHub profile.
  - Basic Git commands (clone, commit, push, pull).
  - Creating repositories and README files.
- Collaboration tools (e.g., Slack, Google Docs).

**Deliverables:**
- All required tools downloaded and configured.
- Written reflection on key QA concepts.
- GitHub repository created with a README explaining the participantâ€™s goals for the program.

**Note:** Participants can expect ~8 assignments/projects over the month, including reading and practical setup tasks. Weekly details will be available in the training folders. GitHub will be used throughout the program to store work and build a QA portfolio.

### **Phase 2: Manual Testing Fundamentals (Month 2)**
**Objective:** Teach the basics of manual testing and introduce foundational concepts that will later be automated.  

**Topics Covered:**
- Test Case Design Techniques (Equivalence Partitioning, Boundary Value Analysis).
- Test Planning and Execution.
- Introduction to Regression Testing: Manual identification and prioritization of regression test cases.
- Writing Effective Bug Reports in Jira.
- Exploratory Testing Techniques.
- Updating GitHub repositories:
  - Adding test cases, bug reports, and exploratory testing documentation.

**Deliverables:**
- Test cases, exploratory testing findings, and bug reports added to GitHub.
- Exploratory testing findings for a demo application.

**Note:** Assignments and projects will emphasize test case writing, planning, and reporting. Weekly breakdowns will be in the training folders.

### **Phase 5: Advanced Topics, Regression Testing, and QA Automation (Month 5)**
**Objective:** Build on foundational manual testing techniques and transition to automation, leveraging GitHub to store automation scripts.  

**Topics Covered:**
- Regression Testing Revisited: Identifying candidates for automation.
- Automation Basics: Tools overview (e.g., Selenium, Playwright).
- Automating Test Case Execution (manual test cases from Month 2).
- Automating Accessibility Testing with Tools (e.g., Axe, Lighthouse).
- Automating API Testing with Postman/Newman.
- Using GitHub for:
  - Storing and managing automation scripts.
  - Using branches for different test types.

**Deliverables:**
- Regression test suite candidates identified and prioritized.
- Automated scripts for test case execution uploaded to GitHub.
- README updated to describe the scripts and their purpose.
- API automation project.

**Note:** Assignments and projects will focus on transitioning manual testing skills to automation workflows.
