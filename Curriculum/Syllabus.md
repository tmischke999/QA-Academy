# QA Academy Program Syllabus

## Program Overview
This six-month program provides comprehensive training in QA methodologies, tools, and best practices. Whether participants are new to QA or looking to deepen their understanding, the structured curriculum ensures a strong foundation through twice-weekly classes, assignments, hands-on projects, and monthly assessments. Participants will start with manual techniques and progress to automation for a holistic learning experience.

## Training Timeline and Structure

### **Phase 1: Foundational Context and Tool Setup (Month 1)**
**Objective:** Build foundational knowledge of QA, ensure all tools are installed and configured, and introduce version control using GitHub.  

**Topics Covered:**
- Introduction to Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and QA.
- QA Roles and Responsibilities.
- Overview of Testing Types: Manual, Accessibility, and API Testing.
- Setting up tools:
  - Text Editors (e.g., VS Code).
  - Postman for API testing.
  - Browser developer tools.
  - Accessibility testing tools (e.g., NVDA, Axe, Lighthouse).
  - Bug tracking tools (e.g., Jira).
- Version Control with GitHub:
  - Setting up a GitHub profile.
  - Basic Git commands (clone, commit, push, pull).
  - Creating repositories and README files.
- Collaboration tools (e.g., Slack, Google Docs).

**Deliverables:**
- All required tools downloaded and configured.
- Written reflection on key QA concepts.
- GitHub repository created with a README explaining the participant’s goals for the program.

### **Phase 2: Manual Testing Fundamentals (Month 2)**
**Objective:** Teach the basics of manual testing and introduce foundational concepts that will later be automated.  

**Topics Covered:**
- Test Case Design Techniques (Equivalence Partitioning, Boundary Value Analysis).
- Test Planning and Execution.
- Introduction to Regression Testing: Manual identification and prioritization of regression test cases.
- Writing Effective Bug Reports in Jira.
- Exploratory Testing Techniques.
- Updating GitHub repositories:
  - Adding test cases, bug reports, and exploratory testing documentation.

**Deliverables:**
- Test cases, exploratory testing findings, and bug reports added to GitHub.
- Exploratory testing findings for a demo application.

### **Phase 3: Accessibility Testing & Introduction to APIs (Month 3)**  
**Objective:**  
This month will cover two key testing areas: accessibility testing and an introduction to APIs. In the first two weeks, students will focus on understanding accessibility standards and techniques, using tools like NVDA, Axe, and Lighthouse to evaluate web applications for accessibility compliance. In the second two weeks, students will transition into learning what APIs are, their role in applications, and how to test them using tools like Postman.

**Topics Covered:**  
- **Weeks 1–2: Accessibility Testing**  
  - WCAG Standards and ARIA Roles  
  - Keyboard Navigation and Focus Testing  
  - Screen Reader Compatibility (NVDA, VoiceOver, TalkBack)  
  - High Contrast and Reflow Testing  
- **Weeks 3–4: Introduction to APIs**  
  - What is an API and how it works  
  - HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)  
  - Introduction to Postman for API testing  
  - Writing basic API test cases and validating responses  

**Deliverables:**  
- **Accessibility Testing Deliverables:**  
  - Custom checklist for accessibility testing  
  - Accessibility audit report for a sample website  
- **API Testing Deliverables:**  
  - Basic API test cases created in Postman  
  - API test documentation uploaded to GitHub  

**Note:**  
Students will continue using Google Sheets to manage test cases and document their work in GitHub. This phase will also include hands-on assignments with real-world accessibility audits and basic API testing practices.

### **Phase 4: Advanced API Testing and Automation (Month 4)**  
**Objective:**  
Month 4 will focus on advancing API testing skills, with an emphasis on Postman collections, writing test scripts, and deeper exploration of API testing. Students will learn how to organize API tests into collections, automate tests using Postman, and handle different HTTP methods and responses. The goal is to build proficiency in manual API testing and introduce automation techniques using Postman/Newman.

**Topics Covered:**  
- **Postman Collections and Test Scripts**  
  - Organizing API tests into Postman collections  
  - Writing and executing test scripts in Postman  
  - Validating responses with assertions  
- **Error Handling and Status Codes**  
  - Handling different HTTP status codes (200, 404, 500, etc.)  
  - Writing tests for response validation and error handling  
- **Automating API Tests**  
  - Introduction to Newman for Postman automation (Free and open-source)  
  - Running automated API tests in a CI/CD pipeline  
  - Writing test scripts to validate API responses  
- **Advanced API Testing Techniques**  
  - Working with environments and variables in Postman  
  - Mocking APIs and testing with simulated data  

**Deliverables:**  
- **Postman Collections:**  
  - Organize API test cases into collections in Postman  
  - Create test scripts to validate API responses  
- **Automation Projects:**  
  - Automate API tests using Postman/Newman and document the setup process  
  - Create an end-to-end API testing project, with documentation and results  
- **Test Summary Reports:**  
  - Write a comprehensive report summarizing API test cases, scripts, and automation results  

**Note:**  
Students will be expected to continue using GitHub for documentation of their API tests, test scripts, and automation projects. They will also work on refining their Postman skills and building a portfolio of automated test cases.
