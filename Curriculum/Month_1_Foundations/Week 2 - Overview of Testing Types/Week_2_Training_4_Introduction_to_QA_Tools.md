Students do not need to download or set up the tools as part of this session. Tool installation and configuration will be covered in a future session. This assignment is focused on understanding each tool's purpose and usage.

### Task: Explore and Document QA Tools
1. Explore the tools listed above by reading their documentation and tutorials.
2. Write a brief report (1–2 paragraphs per tool) that includes:
   - The purpose of each tool.
   - An example scenario where it might be used in QA.
