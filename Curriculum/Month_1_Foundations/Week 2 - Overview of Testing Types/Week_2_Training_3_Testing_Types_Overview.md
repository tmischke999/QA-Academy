# Week 2: Training 3 - Testing Types Overview

---

## Objective
Introduce students to the different types of testing commonly used in QA. By the end of this training, students will:
- Understand the basics of manual testing, accessibility testing, and API testing.
- Gain foundational knowledge of WCAG guidelines and HTTP methods.
- Be able to identify the use cases and importance of each testing type in QA workflows.

## Topics Covered

### 1. What is Manual Testing?
Manual testing involves testing software manually to ensure it behaves as expected.
- **Key Characteristics:**
  - Performed without the use of automation tools.
  - Focused on identifying defects from the user’s perspective.
  - Includes activities such as exploratory testing, test case execution, and reporting issues.
- **Benefits:**
  - Helps identify usability and design issues.
  - Allows for detailed exploratory testing where automation is not feasible.
- **Limitations:**
  - Time-consuming and prone to human error.
  - Not suitable for repetitive tasks or large datasets.

### 2. Introduction to Accessibility Testing and WCAG Basics
Accessibility testing ensures that software is usable by individuals with disabilities, in compliance with guidelines such as WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).
- **Key Concepts:**
  - **WCAG Guidelines:** Provide standards for making web content accessible (e.g., Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust principles).
  - **Testing Methods:**
    - Keyboard Navigation Testing: Verifying that all functionalities are accessible via keyboard.
    - Screen Reader Testing: Ensuring compatibility with screen readers like NVDA.
    - Contrast Testing: Checking for sufficient color contrast between text and background.
- **Importance:**
  - Ensures equal access for all users.
  - Improves usability and reduces legal risks.

### 3. Overview of API Testing: HTTP Methods and Endpoints
API testing focuses on verifying the communication between different software systems.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - **What is an API?**
    - An Application Programming Interface (API) allows software to communicate with each other via requests and responses.
  - **HTTP Methods:**
    - **GET:** Retrieve information from a server.
    - **POST:** Send data to create a new resource.
    - **PUT:** Update an existing resource.
    - **DELETE:** Remove a resource.
  - **Endpoints:**
    - Specific URLs where APIs can be accessed, such as `/users` or `/products`.

**Key Insight:** API testing ensures that data is sent and received as expected and that the API handles errors gracefully.

## Assignment

### Task: Research and Summarize a Testing Type
- Choose one of the following testing types to research:
  - Manual Testing
  - Accessibility Testing
  - API Testing
- Write a short summary (1–2 paragraphs) in Google Docs. Your summary should include:
  - A brief explanation of the testing type.
  - Its benefits and limitations.
  - An example of how it might be used in a QA process.

### Submission Instructions:
1. Open Google Docs and create a new document.
2. Title your document: **"Week 2 Training 3 - [Testing Type] Summary"**.
3. Complete the summary based on your research.
4. Share your Google Doc via the Slack group or email it to the instructor.
