     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/month1-final-project
     ```
   - **Add all relevant files**:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Add Month 1 final project files and summaries"
     ```
   - **Merge branch into main**:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git merge feature/month1-final-project
     ```
   - **Push to GitHub**:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

### Part 2: Reflection Document
Write a **Reflection Document** and include the following:
- **Key Takeaways**: Summarize the key concepts and skills acquired during Month 1. This can include any challenges you faced and what you found most rewarding.
- **Challenges and Solutions**: What were some of the challenges you faced in learning these tools and processes? How did you overcome them?
- **Applications in QA**: Reflect on how the tools and concepts you learned could be applied in real QA environments.

**Submit this reflection document** by adding it to your repository and pushing it as a separate commit:
```bash
git add reflection_month1.txt
git commit -m "Add Month 1 reflection document"
git push origin main
```
