    - [ ] **Git and GitHub**: Ensure Git is configured (username and email), and the repository has been cloned successfully.
    - [ ] **Postman**: Install Postman, set up a new workspace, and configure environment variables.
    - [ ] **Browser Developer Tools**: Make sure they know how to access dev tools in Chrome or Firefox.
    - [ ] **Accessibility Testing Tools**: Verify that **NVDA**, **Axe**, **Lighthouse**, **Wave**, **Color Contrast Checker**, and **WAVE** are installed and ready to use.
    - [ ] **Jira**: Ensure that they can create and update issues within their project.
    - [ ] **Git Configuration**: Confirm Git installation and linking to GitHub. 

### 2. Setting Up Postman 
- **Download and Install Postman**:
  1. **Visit [Postmanâ€™s website](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)**.
  2. **Download** the appropriate version for your system (Windows or Mac).
  3. **Install** and open Postman.
  4. **Create an Account**: Sign up with your email to save your workspace.

## Practical Assignment

### Part 1:
Students will submit a comprehensive GitHub repository showcasing everything they've worked on in Month 1. This will demonstrate mastery of foundational QA tools, Git, and GitHub.

#### **Repository Structure**
- **Detailed Organization Guidelines**:
  1. **Root Directory**:
     - **README.md**: Provide an overview of what was covered during Month 1. Include summaries of each training week and your learning journey.
  2. **Directories**:
     - **Assignments**: Create a directory named `assignments/` where each file (QA reflection, SDLC diagram, etc.) is stored logically.
     - **Accessibility Audits**: Create a folder called `accessibility_audits/` for all reports related to accessibility exercises.
     - **Branches**: Ensure a separate branch for final submissions (`feature/month1-final-project`) to demonstrate feature work.
  3. **Commit History**:
     - **Commit Messages**: Write clear and descriptive messages like:
       - "Add SDLC flow diagram created in Training 2"
       - "Initial accessibility audit using Lighthouse"

#### **Final Git Commands to Submit**:
- **Create a new branch**:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/month1-final-project
```

- **Add all relevant files**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Month 1 final project files and summaries"
```
- **Merge branch into main**:
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature/month1-final-project
```
- **Push to GitHub**:
```bash
git push origin main
```

  
### Part 2: Setting Up Postman Environment and Practical Assignment
Students will create a Postman environment and complete an API request setup to gain practical experience.

#### **Environment and API Request Practical Assignment**

1. **Review Postman tutorial** - [Variables and Environments](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/variables-intro/)

2. **Create Workspace**:
   - **Create a new workspace** in Postman named `QA Academy`:
     1. **Select Workspaces** from the top navigation.
     2. Click on **Create Workspace**.
     3. The setup should default to **Blank Workspace**. Click **Next**.
        - Note: You can check out the other workspace options later.
     4. In the **Name** field, type `QA Academy`.
     5. Under **Who can access your workspace?**, keep it set to **Personal**, then click **Create**.

   - **Review Available Workspaces**:
     1. Select **Workspaces** from the top navigation.
     2. Ensure that two workspaces are available:
        - `QA Academy`
        - `My Workspace` (default)

3. **Create Environment and Variables**:
   - **Select Environment from the Left Navigation**:
     1. On the left-hand side of Postman, click **Environments**.
     2. Click the **Create Environment** link located in the environment panel.

   - **Add Environment Details**:
     1. **Name**: Enter `QA` for the environment name.

   - **Add Variables**:
     1. Under the new `QA` environment, enter the following information:
        - **Variable Name**: Enter `baseURL`.
        - **Initial Value**: Enter `https://postman-echo.com`.
        - **Current Value**: Enter `https://postman-echo.com`.
     2. Click **Save**.
        - This variable will be used to store the base URL for your API requests.

   - **Review Available Environments**:
     1. In the **Environment** panel, ensure that two environments are available:
        - `Globals` (default)
        - `QA`

4. **Create Collection**:
   - **Create a new collection** in Postman named `QA Academy`:
     1. Select **Collections** from the left navigation.
     2. Click the **Create Collection** button located in the environment panel. 
     3. **Name**: Enter `QA Academy` for the collection name.

5. **Perform a Basic API Request using Postman Echo**:
   - We will use Postman's [Postman Echo](https://www.postman-echo.com/get) as a practice API to understand how requests work.
     1. **Create a New Request** in the `QA Academy` collection.
        - Click on the **Add a request** link within your collection.
        - **Name**: Enter `GET Postman Echo` for the request name.
     2. **Set the Method Type**:
        - Click on the dropdown to the left of the URL field.
        - Select **GET** as the method type.
     3. **Set Up the Request URL**:
        - In the **URL field**, enter `{{baseURL}}`.
        - This uses the variable you created for the base URL, which makes the request flexible and reusable.
        - Tip: Hover over the variable to see the value.
     4. **Add Parameters**:
        - Click on the **Params** tab.
        - Add a parameter called `sampleKey` with a value of `sampleValue`.
        - Note how the URL value updates.
     5. **Send the Request**:
        - Click the **Send** button to make the request.
     6. **View the Response**:
        - Observe the response in the **Body** tab.
        - Notice how the parameters you added appear in the response.
     7. **Add Documentation**:
        - Click on the Documentation icon in the right navigation to add a short description.
        - Explain that this is a practice GET request to understand how the Postman Echo API returns data.
     8. **Save the Request**:
        - Save the request in a collection named `QA Academy Practice Requests` for future reference.

### Export Postman Workspace and Environment

**Export Environment**:
- Click **Environment** in the left navigation of Postman.
- Click the ellipsis next to your `QA` environment.
- Select **Export** from the dropdown menu.  
- Save the JSON file.

**Export Collection**:
- Click **Collections** in the left navigation of Postman.
- Click the ellipsis next to your `QA Academy` environment.
- Select **Export** from the dropdown menu.  
- Save the JSON file.

**Submit**:
- Upload both JSON files (environment and collection) to the Slack channel for review and feedback.


### **Part 3: Reflection Document**
- **Key Takeaways**: Summarize the key skills acquired.
- **Challenges and Solutions**: Reflect on challenges and how they were overcome.
- **Applications in QA**: Describe how these tools and concepts will be useful in a QA role.

**Submit this reflection document** as a separate commit:
