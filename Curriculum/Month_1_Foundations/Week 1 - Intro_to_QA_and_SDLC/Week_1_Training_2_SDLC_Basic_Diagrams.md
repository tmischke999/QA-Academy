# Week 1: Training 2 - Introduction to SDLC and Basic Diagram Creation

## Objective
Introduce students to the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and demonstrate QA's role in each phase. By the end of this training, students will:
- Understand the key phases of the SDLC.
- Recognize the importance of QA in each phase.
- Create a simple SDLC flow diagram using Google Docs or Sheets.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Phases of SDLC
The SDLC is a structured process for software development, typically consisting of the following phases:
- **Requirements Phase:**
  - Gathering and documenting customer needs and expectations.
  - **QA's Role:** Ensure requirements are clear, complete, and testable.
- **Development Phase:**
  - Writing and implementing code based on the requirements.
  - **QA's Role:** Collaborate with developers to identify potential defects early.
- **Testing Phase:**
  - Validating that the software meets the requirements and identifying defects.
  - **QA's Role:** Create and execute test cases to verify functionality and quality.
- **Deployment Phase:**
  - Releasing the software to production for end-user use.
  - **QA's Role:** Verify that deployment is successful and meets user expectations.

**Key Insight:** QA is not just about testing—it is about ensuring quality at every stage of development, and early QA involvement reduces costs and ensures a smoother development process.

### 2. QA’s Role in Each SDLC Phase
QA involvement in the SDLC helps identify and resolve issues at every stage:
- **Early Phases (Requirements/Design):**
  - Prevent defects by clarifying ambiguous requirements.
  - Provide test scenarios during planning.
- **Middle Phases (Development/Testing):**
  - Collaborate with developers to resolve defects.
  - Execute manual and automated tests.
- **Final Phases (Deployment/Maintenance):**
  - Validate successful deployment.
  - Ensure updates and fixes do not introduce new issues.

**Key Insight:** Early QA involvement reduces costs and ensures a smoother development process.

### 3. Using Google Docs/Sheets to Create Flow Diagrams
- **Google Docs:**
  - Use the "Insert > Drawing > New" option to create a basic flowchart.
  - Add shapes (e.g., rectangles for phases) and arrows to show progression.
- **Google Sheets:**
  - Use cells as a grid for creating simple diagrams.
  - Add shapes via the "Insert > Drawing" menu.

## Assignment
### Task: Create an SDLC Flow Diagram
- Use Google Docs or Sheets to create a basic SDLC flow diagram.
- Include the following:
  - All four SDLC phases (Requirements, Development, Testing, Deployment).
  - A brief note for QA's role in each phase.
  - Arrows to indicate the sequence of phases.

### Submission Instructions:
1. Save your completed diagram as a Google Doc or Sheet.
2. **Submitting Your Work:**
   - **Option 1 (Preferred):**  
     - Share your completed Google Doc or Sheet with the instructor by using the provided email address.  
     - Alternatively, share the document link directly in the Slack group for feedback (ensure the sharing permissions allow "Anyone with the link" to view or comment).  
   - **Option 2 (Optional):**  
     - Save the document in your Drive for future use.  
     - You will learn how to upload it to GitHub in Week 3.

### Notes:
- If sharing in Slack, copy the document link (File > Share > Copy link) and post it in the designated Slack channel (e.g., `#qa-academy`) with a message like:  
  *"Here is my completed SDLC flow diagram for Training 2: [Your Name]. Please review!"*

## Key Interview Questions
At the end of this training, students should be able to confidently answer the following questions in an interview:
1. What are the key phases of the SDLC, and what happens in each phase?
2. What is QA’s role in the SDLC, and why is it important?
3. How can QA involvement in early SDLC phases improve software quality?

---

## Tips for Success
- Take notes on each SDLC phase and QA’s role during the session.
- Review the free online resources for additional context and examples.
- Ensure your flow diagram is clear and effectively shows the relationship between SDLC phases and QA responsibilities.
- Keep a **log of interview questions** you encounter during this course to help you prepare for interviews.

### Next Training
In **Training 3**, we will explore the different types of testing, including manual, accessibility, and API testing.
