# Month 1 Itinerary: Foundations

## Overview
This month focuses on building foundational knowledge of Quality Assurance (QA), ensuring all tools are properly installed and configured, and introducing version control using GitHub. Participants will develop an understanding of core QA concepts and establish the tools and workflows needed for the program. By the end of the month, participants will have completed all initial setup tasks, created their own GitHub repositories, and gained hands-on experience with essential QA and accessibility tools.
