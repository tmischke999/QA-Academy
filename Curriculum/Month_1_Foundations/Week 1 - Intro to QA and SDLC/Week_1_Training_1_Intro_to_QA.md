# Week 1: Training 1 - Introduction to QA

## Objective
Introduce students to the role of Quality Assurance (QA) in software development. By the end of this training, students will understand:
- How QA fits into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
- The roles and responsibilities of a QA professional.
- The concept of software quality and why it is critical to successful development.

---

## Topics Covered

### 1. Overview of QA in the SDLC
- QA ensures the quality of software products by identifying and addressing defects early in the SDLC.
- QA is involved in various SDLC phases:
  - **Requirements Phase:** Reviewing and clarifying requirements to identify potential ambiguities.
  - **Development Phase:** Collaborating with developers to prevent defects during implementation.
  - **Testing Phase:** Verifying that the product meets requirements and is free of defects.
  - **Deployment Phase:** Ensuring the product works as expected in production.

**Key Insight:** QA is not just about testing—it's about ensuring quality at every stage of development.

### 2. QA Roles and Responsibilities
QA professionals have a wide range of responsibilities, including:
- **Requirement Analysis:** Reviewing requirements to ensure they are clear, testable, and complete.
- **Test Planning:** Defining what needs to be tested, how it will be tested, and the resources needed.
- **Test Case Creation:** Designing test cases that verify requirements are met.
- **Execution of Tests:** Running tests to find defects and document results.
- **Defect Reporting:** Clearly documenting issues and collaborating with developers to resolve them.
- **Regression Testing:** Verifying that new changes do not negatively impact existing functionality.
- **Communication:** Reporting quality metrics and test results to stakeholders.

### 3. Understanding Quality in Software
- **What is Software Quality?**
  - Software quality means meeting customer expectations by delivering a product that is reliable, functional, secure, and easy to use.

- **Dimensions of Quality:**
  - **Functional:** Does the product do what it’s supposed to do?
  - **Performance:** Does the product work quickly and efficiently?
  - **Usability:** Is the product easy to use?
  - **Security:** Does the product protect users’ data and privacy?

**Key Insight:** High-quality software reduces costs, improves user satisfaction, and increases business success.

## Assignment
### Task: Reflect on QA’s Importance
- Write a one-page reflection on the importance of QA in software development. Use the following guiding questions:
  1. What role does QA play in ensuring software quality?
  2. Why is QA important in the Software Development Life Cycle?
  3. How can effective QA practices benefit users and businesses?

### Submission Instructions:
1. Open the **QA Reflection Template**: [Insert Google Docs Template Link Here].
2. Click **File > Make a copy** to create your own editable version.
3. Complete the reflection by answering the guiding questions.
4. **Submitting Your Work:**
   - **Option 1 (Preferred):**  
     - Share your completed Google Doc with the instructor by using the provided email address.  
     - Alternatively, share the Google Doc link directly in the Slack group for feedback (ensure the sharing permissions allow "Anyone with the link" to view or comment).  
   - **Option 2 (Optional):**  
     - Save the Google Doc in your Drive for future use.  
     - You will learn how to upload it to GitHub in Week 3.

### Notes:
- If sharing in Slack, copy the Google Doc link (File > Share > Copy link) and post it in the designated Slack channel (e.g., `#qa-academy`) with a message like:  
  *"Here is my completed QA reflection for Training 1: [Your Name]. Please review!"*
