  # Month 4 Itinerary: Advanced API Testing and Automation

## Overview

In Month 4, students will advance their API testing skills by integrating JavaScript for Postman test scripts, exploring automation techniques, and learning how to integrate automated tests into CI/CD pipelines. This month builds upon the foundational knowledge gained in Month 3, ensuring students are equipped with the skills to tackle real-world QA challenges.

By the end of Month 4, students will:

- Gain a practical understanding of JavaScript and its role in QA testing.
- Master the use of Postman collections and Newman for API test automation.
- Execute a comprehensive API testing project, combining manual and automated testing techniques.
