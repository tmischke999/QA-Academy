## Topics Covered

### 1. Test Planning Basics

**What is a Test Plan?**  
A test plan is a detailed document that outlines the testing strategy, objectives, schedule, resources, deliverables, and the approach to be followed during testing.

**Key Components of a Test Plan**:

- **Scope**: What features are covered in the testing?
- **Objectives**: What are we trying to achieve with the tests?
- **Testing Schedule**: When will the testing be conducted?
- **Resources and Responsibilities**: Who will perform the testing?

**Why is Test Planning Important?**  
It helps ensure comprehensive coverage, organizes the team's efforts, and ensures that no critical area is missed.

### 2. Creating a Simple Test Plan for OpenCart

Students will be tasked with creating a simple test plan for the **OpenCart registration and login features**.

**Contents of the Test Plan**:

- **Objective**: To validate the correctness of the registration and login workflows.
- **Scope**: Registration and login features of the OpenCart demo site.
- **Responsibilities**: Each student will be responsible for executing their own test cases and reporting results.
- **Test Environment**: OpenCart demo site with standard browser and network setup.

**Key Insight**: A test plan acts as a guide to the testing effort and helps ensure that all critical aspects are covered in a systematic manner.

### 3. Test Execution

**What is Test Execution?**  
Test execution is the process of running the test cases that have been designed, documenting the outcomes, and logging any defects that arise.

**Steps in Test Execution**:

- **Review Test Cases**: Go through the test cases and ensure clarity.
- **Set Up Test Environment**: Make sure the environment is properly set up (e.g., browser settings, OpenCart URL).
- **Execute Test Cases**: Follow the steps detailed in each test case.
- **Document Results**: Record whether the outcome was as expected.
- **Log Defects**: If any issues are found, log them for future action.

**Key Insight**: Proper documentation of test results is crucial for effective debugging and ensuring that all stakeholders understand the current state of the product.

## Assignment

### Accessing the OpenCart Demo Site

Students will use the following **OpenCart demo site** to conduct the test executions:  
**OpenCart Demo Site**: [https://demo.opencart.com/](https://demo.opencart.com/)

Students will use the [Guru99 Test Plan Template (Sample Document Example)](https://www.guru99.com/test-plan-for-project.html) as a template.

### Part 1: Create a Simple Test Plan

- **Objective**: Create a test plan that details how you intend to test the **registration and login features** on the OpenCart site.
- **Instructions**:
  - Create a **Google Doc** to serve as your test plan.
  - Include:
    - **Objective**: What are you aiming to test?
    - **Scope**: Which features will be tested (e.g., registration, login)?
    - **Testing Schedule**: Set a time to complete testing this week.
    - **Responsibilities**: List your responsibilities for executing the tests.
    - **Environment**: OpenCart demo environment details.

### Part 2: Execute Test Cases

- **Objective**: Execute the **registration and login test cases** that were developed during **Training 1** and **Training 2**.
- **Instructions**:
  - Use your **Google Sheets** document containing test cases.
  - Follow the steps outlined in each test case to execute it on the OpenCart demo site.
  - Document the **actual results** of each test case in the same Google Sheets document.
  - **Identify Defects**: Note any deviations from the expected results and document these as defects for discussion.

**Template Update**: Update the Google Sheets to include:

- **Actual Result** column: Indicate whether the test case passed or failed.
- **Defect ID** (if applicable): If a defect was found, note it and add details.

## Submission Instructions

- **How to Submit**:
  - Share the **Test Plan Google Doc** link in the designated Slack channel.
  - Update the **Google Sheets document** with actual results and share it for feedback.
  - Ensure sharing permissions are set to "Anyone with the link can view/comment."

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Learn how to create a simple yet effective test plan.
- Gain practical experience in executing test cases and documenting results.
- Understand the importance of systematic test execution and accurate defect logging.

## Key Interview Questions

At the end of this training, students should be able to confidently answer the following questions in an interview:

1. What is a test plan, and why is it important?
2. What are the main components of a test plan?
3. Describe the process of executing a test case.
4. What steps do you take if a test case fails during execution?

## Tips for Success

- **Be Thorough**: Make sure each test case is executed precisely as written.
- **Document Everything**: Accurately record the results, and be clear about the difference between actual vs. expected outcomes.
- **Practice Test Planning**: The test plan helps guide your actions—try to make it comprehensive and realistic.
- **Collaborate in Slack**: Don’t hesitate to share any difficulties you encounter during execution; your peers may have insights that can help.
