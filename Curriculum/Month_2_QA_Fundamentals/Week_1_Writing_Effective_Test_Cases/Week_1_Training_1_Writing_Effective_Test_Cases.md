# **Week 1: Training 1 - Writing Effective Test Cases**

## **Objective**
Introduce students to the fundamentals of creating well-structured test cases that ensure clarity, consistency, and completeness. By the end of this training, students will understand:
- The essential elements of a good test case.
- Best practices for writing clear and reusable test cases.
- How to create test cases for both positive and negative scenarios.

## **Free Online Resources**
To supplement this training, students are encouraged to explore the following resources before diving into the topics:

1. [How to Write Test Cases (Guru99)](https://www.guru99.com/test-case.html)  
   - A beginner-friendly explanation on writing effective test cases.

2. [Test Case Template with Explanation (SoftwareTestingMaterial)](https://www.softwaretestingmaterial.com/test-case-template-with-explanation/)  
   - A detailed guide and template for writing test cases, covering all the essential components.

## **Topics Covered**

### **1. Test Case Structure**
- **Title and ID**: Importance of having clear, unique identifiers for each test case.
- **Preconditions**: Necessary setup required before executing a test.
- **Test Steps**: Detailed instructions on how to execute the test.
- **Expected Results**: Defining measurable outcomes to verify the test.
- **Postconditions**: Actions to be taken after the test completes (e.g., clean-up).

**Key Insight:** A well-structured test case provides repeatable instructions and consistent results, ensuring that testing efforts are understandable and easy for other team members to use.

---

### **2. Characteristics of Good Test Cases**
- **Measurable**: Clearly defined outcomes that can be verified.
- **Independent**: Test cases should be able to be executed individually without dependencies on other tests.
- **Repeatable**: Anyone should be able to follow the steps and reproduce the test.
- **Traceable**: Each test case should trace back to a specific requirement.

---

### **3. Best Practices for Writing Test Cases**
- **Using Consistent Formats**: Ensuring all key fields are covered.
- **Step Clarity**: Steps should be broken down and clear enough for a new person to understand.
- **Avoiding Ambiguity**: Use precise data, e.g., "Enter 'example@mail.com'" instead of "Enter valid email."

**Key Insight:** A consistent format helps maintain clarity, allowing QA professionals or developers to easily interpret and reproduce the tests.

## **Assignment**
### **Part 1: Setting Up Google Drive Folders**
- **Objective**: Ensure students have a structured and organized workspace in Google Drive for easy access to all course materials.
- **Instructions**:
  - Create a top-level folder named **QA Academy** in Google Drive.
  - Inside the **QA Academy** folder, create subfolders for each month of the course:
    - **Month 1 - Foundations**
    - **Month 2 - Manual Testing Fundamentals**
    - Continue adding for future months.
  - Store all assignments, resources, and reflections in their respective monthly folders.

### **Part 2: Create Test Cases for Registering a User on OpenCart**
- **Objective**: Students will create a set of initial test cases for the **registration feature** on the OpenCart demo site using Google Sheets.
- **Template**: Students can use the Test Case Template provided [here](https://www.smartsheet.com/test-case-templates-examples?srsltid=AfmBOopXJ5Z8wUCQaGSa3ovipcgVeOI0HNG2-7L3EIs2TDGlpp0wTY5M#manual-testing-test-case-template) and copy it into their Google Sheets to maintain a structured format. Update the template to include the following: 
  - **Test Case ID**: Unique identifier for the test case.
  - **Title**: Brief title that describes the scenario being tested.
  - **Preconditions**: The starting conditions required for the test.
  - **Test Steps**: Clear and sequential steps to execute the test.
  - **Expected Results**: What should happen after executing each step.
  - **Postconditions**: Any follow-up actions required after the test is complete.
- **Scenarios to Cover**:
  - Positive Scenarios: Successful registration with valid inputs.
  - Negative Scenarios: Missing fields, invalid email formats, mismatched passwords, etc.

### **Accessing the OpenCart Demo Site**
- Students will use the following **OpenCart demo site** to practice writing test cases:
  - **OpenCart Demo Site**: [https://demo.opencart.com/](https://demo.opencart.com/)
  - Focus for this session will be on the **registration feature**.

**Note**: In future sessions, we will continue to expand on these test cases by adding more features of the OpenCart demo, such as **login**, **checkout**, and others, to build a comprehensive understanding of test case development.

## **Submission Instructions**
- **How to Submit**: 
  - Complete the Google Sheet and share the link in the designated Slack channel for feedback.
  - Ensure that the sharing settings allow "Anyone with the link" to view.

---

## **Key Learning Outcomes**
- Students will learn how to structure a test case effectively.
- Students will develop an understanding of what makes a test case reusable and traceable.
- Students will gain experience writing test cases for different types of scenarios (positive and negative).

## **Key Interview Questions**
At the end of this training, students should be able to confidently answer the following questions in an interview:
1. What are the key components of a test case?
2. What characteristics make a good test case?
3. How do you write a test case for a negative scenario?
4. Why is it important for a test case to be independent and repeatable?
5. How do you ensure traceability in test cases?

## **Tips for Success**
- **Take Notes**: Keep notes on how to structure different elements of a test case.
- **Practice Writing Test Cases**: The more practice you get with different scenarios, the more confident you will become.
- **Collaborate on Slack**: Share your assignment and challenges in the Slack channel for peer and mentor feedback.
- **Review Online Resources**: The free online resources will provide further examples to guide your learning.

## **Next Training**
In **Training 2**, we will introduce techniques for optimizing testing coverage, including **Equivalence Partitioning** and **Boundary Value Analysis**. Be prepared to apply these techniques to enhance the test cases created during this session.
