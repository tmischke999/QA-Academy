# **Month 5: Advanced Testing Techniques and UI Automation (Updated)**

## **Overview**

In Month 5, students will focus on mastering performance testing, advanced UI automation using Playwright, and integrating testing techniques into real-world scenarios. The month provides a deeper understanding of creating robust, scalable tests and prepares students for comprehensive QA projects.

By the end of Month 5, students will:

- Conduct performance testing using tools like Lighthouse and JMeter.
- Develop foundational and advanced skills in UI automation using Playwright.
- Create and debug robust test scripts for cross-browser/device testing.
- Complete a comprehensive end-of-month project consolidating all learned skills.

## **Looking Ahead**

In Month 6, students will undertake a capstone project that consolidates all the skills learned throughout the QA Academy. They will create a comprehensive test plan, execute test cases covering multiple testing types (e.g., accessibility, API, UI), and document findings in a professional test summary report. Additionally, students will focus on career preparation, including tailoring resumes for QA roles, preparing for interviews, and showcasing their portfolio-ready deliverables.
