# **Month 5: Advanced Testing Techniques and UI Automation**

## **Overview**

In Month 5, students will deepen their understanding of performance and exploratory testing while gaining foundational skills in UI automation using Playwright. This month builds on the knowledge gained in previous months, ensuring students can confidently execute advanced testing scenarios, document results effectively, and transition into UI automation.

By the end of Month 5, students will:

- Conduct performance testing using tools like Lighthouse and JMeter.
- Develop exploratory testing skills, identifying edge cases and documenting findings.
- Learn to execute and modify UI automation tests with Playwright.
- Complete a comprehensive end-of-month project consolidating all learned skills.

## **Looking Ahead**

In Month 6, students will undertake a capstone project that consolidates all the skills learned throughout the QA Academy. They will create a comprehensive test plan, execute test cases covering multiple testing types (e.g., accessibility, API, UI), and document findings in a professional test summary report. Additionally, students will focus on career preparation, including tailoring resumes for QA roles, preparing for interviews, and showcasing their portfolio-ready deliverables.
