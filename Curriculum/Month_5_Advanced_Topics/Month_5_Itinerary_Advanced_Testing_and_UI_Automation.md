  # **Month 5: Advanced Testing Techniques and UI Automation**

## **Overview**

In Month 5, students will deepen their understanding of performance and exploratory testing while gaining foundational skills in UI automation using Playwright. This month is structured to build on the knowledge gained in previous months, ensuring students can confidently execute advanced testing scenarios and document results effectively.

By the end of Month 5, students will:

- Conduct performance testing using tools like Lighthouse and JMeter.
- Develop exploratory testing skills, identifying edge cases and documenting findings.
- Learn to execute and modify UI automation tests with Playwright.
- Complete a comprehensive end-of-month project consolidating all learned skills.

## **Week 2: Load Testing**

### **Training 3: Introduction to JMeter**

**Objective**: Understand the basics of load testing and create simple tests using JMeter.

**Topics Covered**:
- What is load testing, and how does it differ from performance testing?
- Setting up a simple JMeter test for a demo API.
- Running a test with a small number of virtual users.

**Assignment**:
- Create and execute a JMeter test with five virtual users.
- Document metrics such as response times and error rates.

---

### **Training 4: Analyzing Load Testing Results**

**Objective**: Analyze load testing results and document insights effectively.

**Topics Covered**:
- How to analyze JMeter reports for bottlenecks.
- Documenting insights and recommendations for optimization.

**Assignment**:
- Compare load test results before and after adjustments.
- Submit a report summarizing findings.

## **Week 3: Exploratory Testing**

### **Training 5: Exploratory Testing Basics**

**Objective**: Introduce exploratory testing methods and heuristics.

**Topics Covered**:
- What is exploratory testing, and why is it valuable?
- Exploratory testing heuristics (e.g., SFDPOT - Structure, Function, Data, Platform, Operations, and Time).
- How to create a simple exploratory testing plan.

**Assignment**:
- Create an exploratory testing checklist.
- Perform a session-based exploratory testing (SBET) on a demo application.

---

### **Training 6: Documenting Exploratory Testing**

**Objective**: Teach students how to document exploratory testing findings and write actionable bug reports.

**Topics Covered**:
- Session-Based Exploratory Testing (SBET): documenting session goals, findings, and time spent.
- Writing actionable bug reports based on exploratory testing results.

**Assignment**:
- Conduct a second exploratory testing session focused on edge cases.
- Create a session-based exploratory testing report (SBET) and submit one detailed bug report.

## **Week 4: UI Automation with Playwright**

### **Training 7: Introduction to Playwright**

**Objective**: Introduce students to UI automation with Playwright and teach them to run pre-built scripts.

**Topics Covered**:
- Overview of UI automation.
- Running pre-built Playwright scripts: step-by-step walkthrough.
- Interpreting Playwright logs, screenshots, and error messages.

**Assignment**:
- Run provided Playwright scripts on a demo application.
- Capture and document results, including logs, screenshots, and test summaries.

---

### **Training 8: End-of-Month Culmination Project**

**Objective**: Consolidate all skills learned during Month 5 into a comprehensive project.

**Topics Covered**:
- Combining learned skills into a cohesive project:
  - Performance testing using Lighthouse or JMeter.
  - Exploratory testing focused on UI edge cases.
  - Automating a critical UI test scenario with Playwright.
- Reflecting on Month 5 and preparing for Month 6.

**Assignment**:
- Develop a project deliverable that includes:
  - A performance testing report (Lighthouse or JMeter).
  - An exploratory testing report (SBET and bug report).
  - A modified Playwright script and its test results.
- Submit all deliverables along with a reflection document summarizing key learnings and challenges.

## **Looking Ahead**

In Month 6, students will undertake a capstone project that consolidates all the skills learned throughout the QA Academy. They will create a comprehensive test plan, execute test cases covering multiple testing types (e.g., accessibility, API, UI), and document findings in a professional test summary report. Additionally, students will focus on career preparation, including tailoring resumes for QA roles, preparing for interviews, and showcasing their portfolio-ready deliverables.
