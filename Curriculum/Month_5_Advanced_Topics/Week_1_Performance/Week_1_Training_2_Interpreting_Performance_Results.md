## **Topics Covered**

### **Topics Covered Summary**
- This section will detail key performance metrics, prioritization of recommendations, and common bottlenecks addressed in web performance testing. Each subsection ensures students understand the context, use cases, and practical applications of the metrics discussed.

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**:

  - **Explanation**: Measures loading performance by timing the largest visible content's load completion.
  - **Key Insight**: LCP values under 2.5 seconds are considered good.
  - **Example**: A hero image on an e-commerce website takes 4 seconds to load, negatively impacting LCP.

- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**:

  - **Explanation**: Tracks unexpected content shifts during page load.
  - **Key Insight**: A CLS score below 0.1 indicates a stable layout.
  - **Example**: A button shifts position after loading ads, frustrating users trying to click.

- **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**:

  - **Explanation**: Measures how quickly a server responds with the first byte of data.
  - **Key Insight**: A TTFB under 200ms is ideal.
  - **Example**: A slow TTFB could result from unoptimized server configurations, delaying page load.

- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**:

  - **Explanation**: Captures the time it takes to render the first piece of visible content.
  - **Key Insight**: Helps identify whether a page responds promptly.
  - **Example**: Text on a blog page renders within 1 second, providing a good FCP.

- **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**:

  - **Explanation**: Measures the time during which the page is unresponsive to user input.
  - **Key Insight**: Lower TBT improves interactivity and user experience.
  - **Example**: Heavy JavaScript execution during load increases TBT and delays interactivity.

- **Interrelationships**:

  - Many metrics are interconnected. For example, improving LCP can positively influence FCP and TBT by optimizing how resources load and render.

- **Interpreting Metrics in Lighthouse**:

  - Lighthouse visually highlights metrics in its report. Focus on:
    - Key metrics in the "Performance" section.
    - Areas marked as "Opportunities" or "Diagnostics" for improvement.

### **2. Prioritizing Recommendations**

- **High-Impact Areas**:

  - **Image Optimization**: How unoptimized images can slow down performance and how compression can improve load times.
  - **Minimizing JavaScript**: The impact of reducing render-blocking scripts and optimizing script execution.

- **Prioritization Strategy**:

  - Focus on recommendations that improve user experience and metrics like TTI and Speed Index.

### **3. Addressing Common Bottlenecks**

- **Frequent Issues**:

  - Render-blocking resources.
  - Uncompressed assets (images and videos).
  - Poor server response times.

- **Actionable Solutions**:

  - Implement lazy loading for images.
  - Leverage caching strategies to speed up repeat visits.
  - Optimize server configurations to reduce response time.

### **4. Creating Performance Reports for Stakeholders**

- **Key Elements of a Report**:
  - **Metrics Analysis**: Highlight key metrics with explanations.
  - **Recommendations**: List top 3 actionable steps with justifications.
  - **Visual Aids**: Use tables or charts to simplify data presentation.
