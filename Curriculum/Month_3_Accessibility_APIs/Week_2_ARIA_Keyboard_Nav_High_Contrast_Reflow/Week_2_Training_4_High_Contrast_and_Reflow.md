### **Topics Covered**

#### **1. High Contrast Testing**

- **Explanation**: High contrast testing involves using color contrast settings to ensure that text and other key elements are easily readable for users with low vision.
  - **Why It Matters**: Proper color contrast is critical for users with low vision, allowing them to differentiate between elements without strain.
  - **Key Insight**: Testing websites in high contrast mode helps uncover issues that might make content unreadable or inaccessible to some users.

#### **2. Reflow Testing**

- **Explanation**: Reflow testing ensures that web content remains usable and properly formatted when resized or viewed at high zoom levels, such as 200% or more. This is important for users relying on screen magnifiers or smaller device screens.
  - **Step-by-Step Practice**: Students will use the browser's zoom settings to evaluate whether all elements of the page reflow correctly, without horizontal scrolling.
  - **Key Insight**: Ensuring content can reflow properly improves usability for users on different devices, including those with visual impairments.

#### **3. Common Accessibility Issues Related to Contrast and Reflow**

- **Explanation**: Discuss common problems that arise during high contrast and reflow testing, such as missing focus indicators, overlapping text, and elements that become hidden or unusable when zoomed in.
  - **Examples**: Examples of good and bad implementations will be reviewed to help students identify issues during their own testing.

### **Assignment**

#### **Part 1: High Contrast Testing**

- **Objective**: Evaluate the contrast of a webpage to ensure all content is readable for users with low vision.
- **Instructions**:
  1. **Choose a public website**.
  2. **Enable high contrast mode** on your device, following the guide from the Microsoft Support link.
  3. **Navigate through the webpage**, focusing on readability, the visibility of buttons, form fields, and any other interactive elements.
  4. Document at least **three issues** related to contrast, describing the potential accessibility barrier and suggesting ways to improve it.

#### **Part 2: Reflow Testing**

- **Objective**: Assess the adaptability of web content when resized or viewed at higher zoom levels.
- **Instructions**:
  1. Use **browser zoom** (up to 200% or higher) to test the same webpage from Part 1.
  2. **Check all content**, ensuring that no horizontal scrolling is necessary, and that all key elements are accessible and properly formatted.
  3. Document at least **two issues** related to reflow, such as overlapping text, hidden elements, or areas requiring horizontal scrolling.
