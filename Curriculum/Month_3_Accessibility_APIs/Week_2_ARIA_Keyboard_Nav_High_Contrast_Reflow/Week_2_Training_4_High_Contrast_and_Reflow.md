### **Topics Covered**

#### **1. High Contrast Testing**

- **Explanation**: High contrast testing involves using color contrast settings to ensure that text and other key elements are easily readable for users with low vision.
  - **Why It Matters**: Proper color contrast is critical for users with low vision, allowing them to differentiate between elements without strain.
  - **Key Insight**: Testing websites in high contrast mode helps uncover issues that might make content unreadable or inaccessible to some users.

#### **2. Reflow Testing**

- **Explanation**: Reflow testing ensures that web content remains usable and properly formatted when resized or viewed at high zoom levels, such as 200% or more. This is important for users relying on screen magnifiers or smaller device screens.
  - **Step-by-Step Practice**: Students will use the browser's zoom settings to evaluate whether all elements of the page reflow correctly, without horizontal scrolling.
  - **Key Insight**: Ensuring content can reflow properly improves usability for users on different devices, including those with visual impairments.

#### **3. Common Accessibility Issues Related to Contrast and Reflow**

- **Explanation**: Discuss common problems that arise during high contrast and reflow testing, such as missing focus indicators, overlapping text, and elements that become hidden or unusable when zoomed in.
  - **Examples**: Examples of good and bad implementations will be reviewed to help students identify issues during their own testing.

### **Assignment**

#### **Part 1: Understand High Contrast and Reflow Issues**
- **Objective**: Learn how high contrast and reflow issues impact accessibility.
- **Instructions**:
  1. Visit the [Accessibility Tool Audit](https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-tool-audit/test-cases.html).
  2. Focus on the following examples:
     - **Color Contrast Issues**: Understand how low contrast ratios affect readability.
     - **Reflow Problems**: Explore issues where content does not adapt correctly to small or zoomed screens.
  3. Write a short explanation (2-3 sentences) for each issue, describing:
     - Why it is a problem for users with low vision or on mobile devices.
     - Which WCAG principle is violated.

#### **Part 2: Practice Testing High Contrast and Reflow**
- **Objective**: Use examples from the **Accessibility Tool Audit** to understand how high contrast and reflow issues manifest in real-world scenarios.
- **Instructions**:
  1. **Review Specific Examples from the Accessibility Tool Audit**:
     - Visit the [Accessibility Tool Audit](https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-tool-audit/test-cases.html).
     - Focus on these examples:
       - **Typography - Very Small Text Found**: Understand the challenges of small text sizes for readability.
       - **Typography - Poor Contrast**: Explore examples of insufficient text contrast against backgrounds.
       - **Content Reflow - Content Overflows Viewport**: Learn how content fails to adapt on zoomed or small screens.
  2. **Test High Contrast and Reflow Scenarios**:
     - **Test 1: Poor Contrast**:
       - Use the example of poor contrast from the Accessibility Tool Audit.
       - Verify contrast ratios using a tool like [Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).
     - **Test 2: Reflow Problems**:
       - Follow the example of content overflow from the Accessibility Tool Audit.
       - Simulate zooming to 200% or resizing the browser to a small screen.
  3. **Document Your Findings**:
     - For each test, write down:
       - The specific example you reviewed from the **Accessibility Tool Audit**.

     ```plaintext
     Title: [Describe the issue concisely]
     Steps to Reproduce:
       1. Open the test case or page with the issue.
       2. [Describe the exact interaction that caused the issue].
     Expected Result: [Describe what should happen].

     ```
     - Example:
       ```plaintext
       Title: Text has insufficient contrast against background

         1. Navigate to the homepage.
         2. Identify the text in the footer section.
       Expected Result: Text should have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.
       Actual Result: Text has a contrast ratio of 2.8:1, making it hard to read.
       WCAG Reference: Perceivable - Contrast Minimum (1.4.3).
       Recommendation: Adjust text and background colors to achieve a 4.5:1 contrast ratio.
       ```
