# **Month 3: Accessibility Testing & Introduction to API Testing**

### **Overview:**
In **Month 3**, students will focus on **accessibility testing** and get hands-on experience with **API testing**. The first two weeks will concentrate on learning about **WCAG guidelines**, **ARIA roles**, **screen reader testing**, and **keyboard navigation testing**. The final two weeks will introduce **Postman** and **API testing**, where students will create **GET** and **POST** requests and learn to validate API responses.

### **Weekly Breakdown:**

---

#### **Week 1: Accessibility Testing - WCAG & Screen Reader**

**Training 1: Introduction to WCAG Guidelines**  
- **Topics Covered**:
  - What is **WCAG**? Learn about the **guidelines** that ensure websites are accessible to people with disabilities.
  - We’ll cover the **four key principles** of WCAG: **Perceivable**, **Operable**, **Understandable**, and **Robust**.

- **Assignment**:
  - Perform a **WCAG audit** on a sample website using tools like **Axe**, **Lighthouse**, and **Wave**.
  - Identify key accessibility issues and document how they can be improved based on WCAG standards.

---

**Training 2: Testing with Screen Readers**  
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Learn how to test websites with **screen readers** like **NVDA** and **VoiceOver**.
  - Ensure **dynamic content** is properly announced and accessible.

- **Assignment**:
  - Test a sample website using **NVDA** (Windows) or **VoiceOver** (Mac/iOS) and document any issues with missing alt text, poor heading structure, or improper content navigation.

#### **Week 2: Accessibility Testing - ARIA Roles & Keyboard Navigation**

**Training 3: Introduction to ARIA Roles**  
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Learn about **ARIA roles** and their role in web accessibility, especially for dynamic content.
  - We’ll focus on **common ARIA roles** like `role="button"`, `role="navigation"`, and `role="dialog"`.

- **Assignment**:
  - **ARIA Evaluation**: Evaluate a website for **ARIA role usage** using **Axe** or manual inspection. Suggest improvements for any missing or incorrect roles.

---

**Training 4: High Contrast and Reflow Testing**  
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Understand **high contrast testing** and its importance for users with low vision.
  - Learn **reflow testing** techniques to ensure content remains usable when zoomed in or resized.

- **Assignment**:
  - Perform **high contrast and reflow testing** on the same website from Training 3.
  - Document any usability challenges for users with visual impairments, including issues identified and suggestions for improvement.

#### **Week 3: Introduction to APIs & Postman Setup**

**Training 5: Introduction to APIs and Postman Setup**  
- **Topics Covered**:
  - What is an **API**? Understand how APIs allow software systems to communicate.
  - Introduction to **Postman** for testing APIs and setting up a workspace.

- **Assignment**:
  - Set up **Postman**, create a workspace, and perform a simple **GET request** to the **Postman Echo API**. Document the status and data you receive in the response.

---

**Training 6: Making GET Requests with Postman**  
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Learn how to make **GET requests** to APIs and understand the structure of the **response** (status codes, headers, body data).

- **Assignment**:
  - Perform another **GET request** to a public API using **Postman Echo** and analyze the response. Make sure to document the **status code** and the **response data** you receive.

---

#### **Week 4: API Testing - POST Requests & Response Validation**

**Training 7: Making POST Requests in Postman**  
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Learn how to send data using **POST requests**. Understand how **POST requests** are structured, including headers and body data (e.g., JSON).

- **Assignment**:
  - Create a **POST request** in **Postman** and send sample data to an API. Document the **request body** and the **response** from the API.

---

**Training 8: Validating API Responses with Postman**  
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Learn how to **validate API responses** by checking the **status code** and **data returned**. Introduce **Postman test scripts** to automate response validation.

- **Assignment**:
  - Write **Postman test scripts** to validate the **POST request** response. Check for a **successful status code** (200) and validate the data returned.

---

### **Key Deliverables for the Month:**
- **Accessibility Audit Report**: A summary of findings from WCAG and ARIA audits.
- **Screen Reader Test Results**: Documentation of screen reader testing.
- **Keyboard Navigation Test Results**: Documentation of keyboard accessibility testing.
- **Postman Collection**: A collection containing **GET** and **POST** requests with validation tests and responses.

---

### **Looking Ahead**:  
In **Month 4**, we will continue building on your **API testing** skills, focusing on more advanced **Postman features** like **collections**, **test automation**, and **response validation**. You’ll gain experience running **Postman collections** and automating your tests, preparing you to handle more complex API testing scenarios and integrate these practices into your testing workflows.
