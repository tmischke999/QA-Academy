### **Topics Covered**

#### **1. Introduction to Screen Readers**
- **Explanation**: Screen readers are assistive technology tools that convert digital text into speech, allowing visually impaired users to interact with web content.
- **Key Insight**: Understanding how screen readers interpret and announce webpage elements helps developers create content that is accessible for all users, particularly those with visual impairments.

#### **2. Setting Up and Using NVDA**
- **Explanation**: NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access) is a free, open-source screen reader for Windows that allows testers to evaluate how accessible a website is for visually impaired users.
  - **Step-by-Step Setup**: Download and install NVDA from [NVDA Download Page](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/). Follow the installation instructions to set up NVDA on your device.
  - **Practice Exercise**: Practice basic navigation with NVDA, including reading through headings, paragraphs, and forms.

#### **3. Keyboard Navigation Testing**
- **Explanation**: Keyboard navigation is an essential aspect of accessibility testing, ensuring that users who cannot use a mouse can still fully interact with web content.
  - **Key Techniques**: Using the **Tab** key to navigate between focusable elements, checking for logical tab order, and ensuring that all interactive elements are accessible.
  - **Key Insight**: All interactive elements should be operable via keyboard alone to comply with accessibility standards and to provide a positive experience for users with motor impairments.

#### **4. Common Issues and Fixes for Screen Reader and Keyboard Navigation**
- **Explanation**: Students will learn about the most common issues affecting screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation, such as missing ARIA labels, improper use of headings, and inaccessible forms.
  - **Key Insight**: Proper labeling and logical structure significantly impact the experience of users relying on assistive technologies.

### **Assignment**

#### **Part 1: Practice Using NVDA**
- **Objective**: Familiarize yourself with NVDA by using it to navigate a sample webpage.
- **Instructions**:
  1. **Download and install NVDA** from the provided link.
  2. **Open a sample webpage** (e.g., [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/)) and use NVDA to explore the content.
  3. **Navigate through headings, links, and forms**, taking note of how NVDA announces different elements.
- **Specific Task**: Write a summary of your experience, including any challenges you faced and areas where the website was either accessible or inaccessible.

#### **Part 2: Keyboard Navigation Test**
- **Objective**: Assess a website for keyboard accessibility.
- **Instructions**:
  1. **Choose a public website** (e.g., a news site or blog).
  2. **Use only your keyboard** to navigate through the entire website.
  3. Pay close attention to how the **Tab** key moves between links, buttons, and form fields.
  4. Identify any areas where focus is lost, elements are skipped, or the navigation order is confusing.
- **Specific Task**: Document at least three navigation issues you encounter, describing the problem and suggesting an improvement based on WCAG guidelines.

### **Submission Instructions**
- **How to Submit**: Compile your findings into a Google Doc and share the link in the designated Slack channel for feedback. Ensure sharing settings allow "Anyone with the link" to view.

---

### **Key Learning Outcomes**
- Gain a hands-on understanding of how screen readers are used to access web content.
- Learn the importance of keyboard navigation and how to identify issues affecting keyboard-only users.
- Develop skills in identifying accessibility issues and suggesting appropriate fixes.

### **Key Interview Questions**
1. What are screen readers, and why are they important for web accessibility?
2. How do you test a website for screen reader compatibility?
3. What are the key elements to check when conducting keyboard navigation testing?
4. Why is logical tab order important for accessibility?

### **Tips for Success**
- **Take Your Time**: Navigating a website with a screen reader can be challenging at first. Take your time to understand how NVDA works.
- **Document Thoroughly**: Keep notes on your experience, especially challenges. This will be useful for the assignment and future accessibility testing.
- **Engage with Peers**: Share your findings on Slack and learn from your peers' experiences.
