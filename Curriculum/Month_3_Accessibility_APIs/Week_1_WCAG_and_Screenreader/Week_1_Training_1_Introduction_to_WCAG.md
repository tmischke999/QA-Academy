### **Topics Covered**

#### **1. What is WCAG?**
- **Explanation**: WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) are a set of guidelines created to ensure websites are accessible to people with disabilities, covering visual, auditory, cognitive, and navigational needs.
- **Key Insight**: The WCAG guidelines are crucial for developing websites that are accessible to a wide range of users, including people with visual impairments, hearing disabilities, or cognitive challenges.

#### **2. The Four Principles of WCAG**
- **Perceivable**: Content must be presented in ways that users can perceive, including providing text alternatives for non-text content, like images, videos, or audio.
  - **Example**: Images without alt text are not perceivable by screen readers for visually impaired users.
- **Operable**: User interface components must be operable by a variety of input methods, such as keyboard navigation. This ensures that all users can interact with a website.
  - **Example**: Websites must be navigable using a keyboard alone, without relying on a mouse.
- **Understandable**: Information and operation must be understandable to all users, including predictable page behavior, simple language, and error identification.
  - **Example**: If a form contains an error, the error message should be clear and explain how to fix it.
- **Robust**: Content must be robust enough to work with current and future technologies, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of devices and user agents.
  - **Example**: A site should work properly on both mobile phones and desktop browsers.

#### **3. Practical Applications of WCAG**
- **Explanation**: Students will review real-world examples of WCAG implementation, understanding how web developers can meet these guidelines to ensure accessibility for all users.
- **Key Insight**: By implementing WCAG principles, developers create more inclusive digital experiences, helping to bridge accessibility gaps for people with disabilities.

### **Assignment**

#### **Part 1: Understand WCAG Guidelines**
- **Objective**: Gain a foundational understanding of WCAG by reviewing the provided resources.
- **Instructions**: Read through the WCAG Quick Reference and watch the WCAG 2.1 Crash Course video.
- **Specific Task**: Write a summary of the four principles of WCAG and provide one example of how each principle can be applied in web development.

#### **Part 2: Perform a WCAG Audit**
- **Objective**: Apply WCAG guidelines to evaluate the accessibility of a sample website.
- **Instructions**:
  - Choose a public website (e.g., a news site, blog, or e-commerce site).
  - Use the **WCAG Quick Reference** to guide your evaluation.
  - Analyze the site for compliance with the **Perceivable**, **Operable**, **Understandable**, and **Robust** principles.
- **Specific Task**: Document at least three accessibility issues you identify, describe the WCAG principle violated, and suggest an improvement.
